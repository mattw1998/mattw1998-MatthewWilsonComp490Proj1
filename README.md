# After running the program you will first be asked to enter job title
# You are then asked to provide a description of the job you entered
# Lastly you are asked to enter relevant personal information to create a personalized resume
# The program compiles these inputs in 3 distinct ways, and receives back 3 different resumes
#
# I chose this Google's LLM, as I found their api to be very simple to use
# 
# From my use of this program I found the 3rd query produced the highest quality resume of the three
# This query placed the personal skills at the beginning of the query, while the others first gave the job title and description
